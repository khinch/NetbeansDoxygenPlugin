# NetbeansDoxygenPlugin
A plugin for Netbeans to make generating HTML docs via Doxygen easier

This plugin is very much a work-in-progress. Ultimately the aim is to provide a couple of simple settings to get started, with optional extra settings that match the settings in Doxywizard's "Wizard" tab. More advanced settings will require to be set manually by editing the Doxyfile or edited with the Doxywizard. An entry is created in the right-click project menu to run the Doxygen generator and produce the docs. 

Once the settings and config gui are ironed out the signed NBM will be added.
